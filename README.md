# Lightning-Tutorials
In this repository, I will make use of the library PyTorch Lightning for creating some popular vision models models. PyTorch Lightning is a framework that simplifies your code needed to train, evaluate, and test a model in PyTorch. It also handles logging into TensorBoard, a visualization toolkit for ML experiments, and saving model checkpoints automatically with minimal code overhead from your side. This is extremely helpful for deep-learning practitioners as we all want to focus on implementing different model architectures and spend little time on other code overhead.
